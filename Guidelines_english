Given the guidelines you've provided and the concept of Classync, a Python-based application for managing interactive English classes, here's a structured plan to develop it:

1. Problem Identification & Requirements
Problem: Managing individualized lesson plans for students in an interactive English class, ensuring smooth scheduling and organization.

Requirements:

A database to store student details, lessons, and schedules.
Automatic organization of lessons based on preset rules.
Real-time updates and notifications.
User-friendly interface for both students and teacher.
2. Code Design & File Organization
Files:

main.py: Entry point of the application.
database.py: Handles all database interactions.
schedule.py: Manages lesson scheduling and organization.
utils.py: Contains utility functions and common classes.
tests.py: For unit testing of different modules.
3. Step-by-Step Coding Plan
Setup the database connection in database.py.
Define functions in schedule.py to categorize and organize lessons.
Implement user authentication and session management in main.py.
Create utility functions in utils.py for common tasks.
Build the main application logic in main.py, integrating other modules.
4. Function Names List
connect_database()
organize_lessons()
schedule_class()
authenticate_user()
send_notification()
test_lesson_organization()
test_schedule_class()
5. Writing the Code
Follow the plan, writing each module and integrating them together. Use the defined functions as a guideline.

6. Testing
Test each module individually and then the system as a whole. Ensure all features work as intended and handle exceptions.

7. Refactoring
Refine the code for readability and efficiency. Ensure the code adheres to PEP 8 standards.

8. Documentation
Comment within the code for clarity.
Write a README file detailing the purpose, setup, and usage of the application.
9. Version Control
Use Git for version control. Regularly commit changes with clear commit messages.

10. Continuous Improvement
Seek feedback and continuously improve the application. Keep abreast of Python updates and best practices.

Additional Best Practices
Follow PEP 8 for style.
Use descriptive variable names.
Ensure each function is focused and clear.
Implement error handling throughout the application.
Choose efficient algorithms and data structures.
Write unit tests for all major functionalities.
Document the purpose and functionality of the code.
Consider security, especially if handling sensitive data.
Contingency Plan
Regularly review and adapt the code as needed.
Stay open to feedback and new ideas.
Balance best practices with practical needs and constraints of the project.
By following this structured approach, Classync can be developed in a manner that's organized, efficient, and scalable, ensuring a robust and user-friendly application for managing English classes.
