Instructions for Further Development:
Expand Database Connection: Flesh out connect_database in database.py to establish a connection to your PostgreSQL database.
Implement Lesson Organization: In schedule.py, write the logic for organize_lessons and schedule_class based on the application's rules.
User Authentication: Code the authenticate_user function in utils.py to handle user login.
Notifications: Develop send_notification to send updates or alerts to users.
Unit Testing: Add tests in tests.py to ensure each component works as expected.
This structure provides a basic framework. You'll need to fill in the details of each function, handle error cases, and ensure that each part of the application interacts correctly with the others. Remember to follow Python best practices and regularly test your code as you develop it.
